### Reveal (Beta) 1.0

### About
My news feed is full of stories about startups. There are way too many of them to keep track of. It was painful to type their name into the browser every time I wanted to know what they did.

### Solution
I built a simple Chrome extension that looks at Angel list and Crunchbase data and displays an non-annoying popup with the company's description.

### Steps
Install the extension and select a text on a webpage. If what you selected is a company name, it will pull the info from Angel list and/or Crunchbase.

The only catch at this point is that, there are no validations. That means you select some random text, you are at the mercy of API gods at Angel list and Crunchbase. Use wisely! :)

Feel free to fork and pull to make this even more awesome!
